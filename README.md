# What Is this? 🤔

    This is a repo that contains source code about simple basic arithmetic calculator.
  I use Apache NetBeans Ver. 28.
Just as same as your calculator on everybody's devices. But not all of this function is work as same as ur device. This apk doesn't support negative numbers that place on the first operations. But it works for the results of the operations.

It can process more than one operation. Just for the example:  


    3 + 1 x 5 \ 2 = ...

## How I Operate It On My Device?🤨
Just download the .zip file and then u install NetBeans and JDK and then run it 😂 JK.  

If u we're super lazy to analyze the source code adn choose to copy mine, I'll tell u how to run it.  
1. U must install Java Development Kit (JDK).  U can have it on [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk25-windows)
2. U must have the IDE for Java. I recommend u to install [NetBeans ver. 28](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html)
3. U have to copy all of the files in this repository
4. Then, u open the NetBeans, and open project
5. Find this project and then run. If U can't run it, press button **Shift + F6**
6. Voila, It's done.
